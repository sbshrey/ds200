This repository contains the scripts for Scatter, box, and bar plot. The data set used for plotting this plot is from the https://data.gov.in under "All India level Mining Production from 2000-01 to 2015-16". 

In the Scatter plot, we can observe that all minerals value shows the positive correlation with years. In the first half of years, the value of all minerals is below the linear line and after that it is above the line. 

In the Box plot, we can observe that the maximum value lies in the box with the median shown by green line in the box. The line on top and bottom shows the maximum and minimum value for the coal and all minerals.

In the bar plot, we can observe that over the period of years all minerals value has been increasing. Each year's minerals value is shown by a bar as the value are independent for each year.
